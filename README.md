# How to get PUBG token with node.js
You need to run this script on machine with runned Steam. I tested it only with Windows Server. Main compontent of this idea is Greenworks, it's a npm library will help with work with Steamworks from js.

#### Required
* Installed Steam on server
* Installed Steamworks https://partner.steamgames.com
* VC 2017 on Windows to build Greenworks

If someone get success with running this with linux - please, write instruction for community.

Thank you and respect to jmswrnr (and big sorry for this repo).

PUBG Developers and community team - disrespect.
